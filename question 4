4. Find the character that appears most number of times in an entered string and output it.

DECLARE Str1 : STRING
DECLARE Char1, MostRepeated : CHARACTER
DECLARE CharCount, Biggest : INTEGER

Str1 ← "" , Char1 ← '' , Mostrepeated ← '' ,CharCount ← 0 , Biggest ← -1

INPUT "Enter string: ", Str1
Str1 ← UCASE(Str1)

FOR i ← 1 TO LEN(Str1)
 Char1 ← MID(Str1,i,1)
  FOR j ← 1 TO LEN(Str1)
   Char2 ← MID(Str2,i,1)
   IF Char1 = Char2 THEN CharCount ← CharCount + 1
  NEXT j
 IF CharCount > Biggest THEN Biggest ← CharCount AND MostRepeated ← Char1
NEXT i

OUTPUT "The most repeated character is: ", MostRepeacted
OUTPUT "Amount of times it was repeated: ", Biggest
