4. Find the character that appears most number of times in an entered string and output it.

DECLARE Str1 : STRING
DECLARE Char1, MostRepeated : CHARACTER
DECLARE Locate1, Biggest : INTEGER

Str1 ← "" , Char1 ← '' , Mostrpeated ← '' , locate1 ← 0 , Biggest ← -1

INPUT "Enter string: ", Str1

FOR i ← 1 to LEN(Str1)
 Char1 ← MID(Str1,i,1)
 Locate1 ← LOCATE(Str1, Char1)
 IF Locate1 > Biggest THEN Biggest ← Locate1 AND MostRepeated ← Char1
NEXT i
OUTPUT "The most repeated chahracter: ", MoatRepeated
OUTPUT "Amount of times the character got repeated: ", Biggest
